# NEPTIS
This project is a landing page built with Next.js and Framer Motion for animations.

# Description
This landing page showcases the capabilities of Next.js, a React framework for building modern web applications, and Framer Motion, a library for creating fluid and engaging animations. The landing page is designed to be visually appealing and interactive, providing an immersive user experience.

# Features
## Next.js: The landing page is built using Next.js, which provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features out of the box.
## Framer Motion: The animations on the landing page are implemented using Framer Motion, a popular animation library for React. It enables smooth transitions, gestures, and other interactive effects.
## Responsive Design: The landing page is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
